Basic defination of CI CD:

CI: Continuous Integration
It’s a part of both Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment, involves the testing and building of any new or updated source code.
	
CD: Continuous Delivery
Involves a manual trigger to Production

CD: Continuous Deployment
Involves an Automatic Release to Production

Q: Why Elastic IP is important & why is it used ? Where can we insert in 3-Tier Architecture ?
An Elastic IP address is a reserved public IP address that you can assign to any EC2 instance in a particular region, 
until you choose to release it. To allocate an Elastic IP address to your account in a particular region
Link: https://asmed.com/amazon-aws-assign-an-elastic-ip-address-to-your-instance/

Q: What is ElasticSearch ? What have you implemented with ES ?


Q: Difference between EKS and ECS ? 

Q: What is Shard ?
A shard is both a unit of storage and a unit of computation. Elasticsearch deploys shards independently to the instances in the cluster to parallelize the storage and processing for the index. And it does this elastically (hence the “elastic” in the name “Elasticsearch”)
 
Symbolic links in Linux ?
A symbolic link (or "symlink") is file system feature that can be used to create a link to a specific file or folder. It is similar to a Windows "shortcut" or Mac "alias," but is not an actual file. Instead, a symbolic link is a entry in a file system that points to a directory or file.
Syntax:
ln -s [OPTIONS] FILE LINK
Eg:
Creating Symlink To a File 
ln -s source_file symbolic_link
ln -s my_file.txt my_link.txt
ls -l my_link.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 linuxize users  4 Nov  2 23:03  my_link.txt -> my_file.txt
Creating Symlinks To a Directory 
ln -s /mnt/my_drive/movies ~/my_movies
Overwriting Symlinks 
ln -s my_file.txt my_link.txt
ln: failed to create symbolic link 'my_link.txt': File exists
ln -sf my_file.txt my_link.txt
Removing Symlinks
unlink symlink_to_remove
rm symlink_to_remove

Q: What does SSH-keygen do?
Ssh-keygen is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. Such key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.
In Cloud we have Key-Pairs to connect EC2 Servers
In Linux: ssh -keygen: provide one public and one private key
In Ansible Configuration: we add the public key to connect with Servers
 
Q: awk command in Linux ? where u have used ?
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH AWK ? 
1. AWK Operations: 
(a) Scans a file line by line 
(b) Splits each input line into fields 
(c) Compares input line/fields to pattern 
(d) Performs action(s) on matched lines 
2. Useful For: 
(a) Transform data files 
(b) Produce formatted reports 
3. Programming Constructs: 
(a) Format output lines 
(b) Arithmetic and string operations 
(c) Conditionals and loops 
Syntax:
awk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file > output-file
Options:
-f program-file : Reads the AWK program source from the file 
                  program-file, instead of from the 
                  first command line argument.
-F fs 
Examples:
$cat > employee.txt 
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000
tarun peon sales 15000
deepak clerk sales 23000
sunil peon sales 13000
satvik director purchase 80000 
1. Default behavior of Awk : By default Awk prints every line of data from the specified file. 
$ awk '{print}' employee.txt
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000
tarun peon sales 15000
$ awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt 
ajay manager account 45000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000 
$ awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt 
ajay 45000
sunil 25000
varun 50000
amit 47000
tarun 15000
Built In Variables In Awk
Awk’s built-in variables include the field variables—$1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 is the entire line) — that break a line of text into individual words or pieces called fields. 
NR: NR command keeps a current count of the number of input records. Remember that records are usually lines. Awk command performs the pattern/action statements once for each record in a file. 
NF: NF command keeps a count of the number of fields within the current input record. 
FS: FS command contains the field separator character which is used to divide fields on the input line. The default is “white space”, meaning space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character (typically in BEGIN) to change the field separator. 
RS: RS command stores the current record separator character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a newline. 
OFS: OFS command stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a blank space. Whenever print has several parameters separated with commas, it will print the value of OFS in between each parameter. 
ORS: ORS command stores the output record separator, which separates the output lines when Awk prints them. The default is a newline character. print automatically outputs the contents of ORS at the end of whatever it is given to print. 
$ awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt: Use of NR built-in variables (Display Line Number) 
1 ajay manager account 45000
2 sunil clerk account 25000
3 varun manager sales 50000
4 amit manager account 47000
5 tarun peon sales 15000
$ awk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt: Use of NF built-in variables (Display Last Field) 
ajay 45000
sunil 25000
varun 50000
amit 47000
tarun 15000
$ awk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' employee.txt: Another use of NR built-in variables (Display Line From 3 to 6) 
3 varun manager sales 50000
4 amit manager account 47000
5 tarun peon sales 15000
6 deepak clerk sales 23000

Q: CloudFront in AWS ?
Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.
If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've defined—such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.
 
Q: RDS: Relational Database System ?
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.
Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types - optimized for memory, performance or I/O - and provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server. You can use the AWS Database Migration Service to easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.
 
Q: How Fargate Works in AWS ?
With Fargate, you only pay for the resources that you have defined in your tasks. For your tasks that will run on demand or on a schedule and don't need a dedicated EC2 instance. With Fargate, you only pay when your task is running. For your tasks that have peaks Memory and/or CPU usage.
Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design. ... You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers.
 
 
Q: Difference between Fargate and ECS ?
To run containers, you have two options. You can use ECS container instances, or you can use Fargate. Both options work together with ECS. The following figure demonstrates the difference.
ECS Container Service: per running EC2 instance	
Fargate: per running task.

Q: What Dockerfile contents ?
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
 
Q: Docker-Compose:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/
 
Q: What is the difference between CMD and entrypoint in a Dockerfile?
In a nutshell: CMD sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs. ENTRYPOINT command and parameters will not be overwritten from command line. Instead, all command line arguments will be added after ENTRYPOINT parameters.

What is jenkinsfile in Jenkins ?
Using a Jenkinsfile
Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control. Consider the following Pipeline which implements a basic three-stage continuous delivery pipeline.
//jenkinsfile(Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline{
	agent any
stages(){
	stage('Build'){
		steps{
			echo 'Building..'
		}
	}
	stage('Test'){
		steps{
			echo "Testing.."
			}
	}
	stage('Deploy'){
		steps{
			echo 'Deploying..'
		}
	}
}
}
//jenkinsfile(Scripted Pipeline)
node {
	stage(){
		echo 'Testing..'
	}
	stage(){
		echo 'Building..'
	}
	stage(){
		echo 'Deploying..'
	}
}















What is a Garbage Collector in Java ??
https://www.javatpoint.com/Garbage-Collection
Garbage means unreferenced objects.
Garbage Collection is the process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. 
In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.
To do so, we were using the free() function in C language and delete() in C++. 
But, in java it is performed automatically. So, java provides better memory management.

Advantage of Garbage Collection:
It makes java memory efficient because the garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.

How can an object be unreferenced?
There are many ways:
By nulling the reference
By assigning a reference to another
By anonymous object etc.	

By nulling the reference:
Employee e1 = new Employee();
e1=null();

By assigning a reference to another:
Employee e1=new Employee();
Employee e2=new Employee();
e1=e2; // now the first object referred by e1 is available for GC

By anonymous object:
new Employee();

The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected. 
This method can be used to perform cleanup processing. This method is defined in Object class as:
protected void finalize(){}

The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage collector to perform cleanup processing. 
The gc() is found in System and Runtime classes.
public static void(){}

Example:
public class TestGarbage1{
 public void finalize(){System.out.println("object is garbage collected");}
 public static void main(String args[]){
  TestGarbage1 s1=new TestGarbage1();
  TestGarbage1 s2=new TestGarbage1();
  s1=null;
  s2=null;
  System.gc();
 }
}
O/P:
Compile by: javac TestGarbage1.java
Run by: java TestGarbage1
object is garbage collected
object is garbage collected

What happens if GC will not be added by Developers ?
It will work automatically even if we don’t define in Java
Free() in C
Delete() in C++



How is a service running on a VM different from Docker Containers ?
Services & Containers are related but both are different things.
A Service can be run by one or more containers.
With docker one can handle multiple containers.
With docker-compose one can handle multiple services.

For example:
Let's say that we have this docker-compose.yml file:

web:
  image: example/my_web_app:latest
  expose:
    - 80
  links:
    - db 

db:
  image: postgres:latest
This compose file defines two services, web and db.

When you run docker-compose up, Assuming that the project directory is test1 then compose will start 2 containers named test1_db_1 and test1_web_1.

$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND          ...      NAMES
1c1683e871dc   test1_web    "nginx -g"       ...      test1_web_1
a41360558f96   test1_db     "postgres -d"    ...      test1_db_1
So, in this point you have 2 services and 1 container for each.

But you could scale the service named web to use 5 containers.

$ docker-compose scale web=5
Creating and starting 2 ... done
Creating and starting 3 ... done
Creating and starting 4 ... done
Creating and starting 5 ... done
In this point you have 2 services and 6 containers

$ docker ps -a  
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND         ...      NAMES
1bf4c939263f   test1_web    "nginx -g"      ...      test1_web_3
d3033964a44b   test1_web    "nginx -g"      ...      test1_web_4
649bbda4d0b0   test1_web    "nginx -g"      ...      test1_web_5
a265ea406727   test1_web    "nginx -g"      ...      test1_web_2
1c1683e871dc   test1_web    "nginx -g"      ...      test1_web_1
a41360558f96   test1_db     "postgres -d'   ...      test1_db_1
Additionally, with docker-compose you can run subcommand against one or more services.

$docker-compose stop web

How to limit the disk space when the docker container runs?
In the current Docker version, there is a default limitation on the Docker container storage of 10Gb.
As the BlazeMeter image is ~5 GB when the sample.jtl reaches ~5 GB, no more free storage will be left in the container. As there will be no more free storage, JMeter won't be able to continue writing samples to the sample.jtl and that can cause the report to be 'stuck'.
The solution is as follows:
Please run the next set of commands in all of your CentOS machines:
1. sudo service docker stop OR sudo systemctl stop docker
2. Create/edit the following file: 
/etc/docker/daemon.json
with the following content:
{
        "storage-driver": "devicemapper",
        "storage-opts": [
                "dm.basesize=40G"
        ]
}
3. sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
4. sudo service docker start OR sudo systemctl start docker
Reinstall the Agent using the regeneration method detailed in this article.
These changes will change the storage limitation in the container to 40 GB and after that, the test should run fine.
NOTE: You can also change the size to whatever you need (i.e. need 50 GB, enter 50G as the value for dm.basesize), as long as your system has the disk space for it. Also, you will not be able to reduce the size once set, so if you make a mistake, you will need to reinstall Docker and our on-premise Agent.

How many types of ELBs present in AWS and what is the difference between them ?
Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers:
Application Load Balancer,
Network Load Balancer and
Classic Load Balancers

Classic Load Balancer
basic load balancing across multiple EC2 instances
built within the EC2-Classic network.
simple load balancing of traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

Application Load Balancer
for microservices or container-based architectures 
need to route traffic to multiple services or load balance across multiple ports on the same EC2
operates at the request level (layer 7), 
advanced load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, 
and provides advanced request routing targeted at delivery of modern application architectures, 
including microservices and container-based applications.
simplifies and improves the security of the application, 
by ensuring that the latest SSL/TLS ciphers and protocols are used at all times.

Network Load Balancer
operates at the connection level (Layer 4), 
routing connections to targets – EC2 instances, microservices, and containers – within VPC based on IP protocol data.
ideal for load balancing of both TCP and UDP traffic,
is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns while using a single static IP address per AZ
is integrated with other popular AWS services such as Auto Scaling, ECS, CloudFormation and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

Note: 
AWS recommends using Application Load Balancer for Layer 7 and Network Load Balancer for Layer 4 when using VPC.

How can restrict to IAM User to delete the S3 bucket but able to view and create in S3 ?
Follow the principle of least privilege. 
Restrict access to your S3 buckets or objects by: 
Writing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies that specify the users that can access specific buckets and objects. 
IAM policies provide a programmatic way to manage Amazon S3 permissions for multiple users


How can I grant a user Amazon S3 console access to only a certain bucket?
Open the IAM console.
From the console, open the IAM user or role that should have access to only a certain bucket.
In the Permissions tab of the IAM user or role, expand each policy to view its JSON policy document.


How can you play with different regions of S3 bucket ?

What are backup and disaster recovery?
There’s an important distinction between backup and disaster recovery. 
Backup: is the process of making an extra copy (or multiple copies) of data. 
You back up data to protect it. You might need to restore backup data if you encounter an accidental deletion, 
database corruption, or problem with a software upgrade.
Disaster recovery: on the other hand, refers to the plan and processes for quickly reestablishing access to applications, 
data, and IT resources after an outage. That plan might involve switching over to a redundant set of servers and storage 
systems until your primary data center is functional again.

Algorithm to use in Elastic Load Balancer ?
Application Load Balancers applies listener rules and assigns the (HTTP/HTTPS) request to a target group. 
It selects a target from that target group using the round robin routing algorithm.
Network Load Balancers node that receives the connection, selects a target from its target group using a flow hash routing algorithm.
Classic Load Balancers uses a round robin routing algorithm for TCP listeners and least outstanding requests routing algorithm for HTTP and HTTPS listeners.

Ansible Architecture:

Ansible Best Tutorials: 
https://www.educba.com/ansible-architecture/

How Ansible Works:
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them. ... Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished. Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required.

Difference between SRE & DevOps:
SRE engineers are responsible for the stability of the production environment, 
but at the same time are committed to new features and operational improvement.
Google decided its SRE teams should be composed of 50 percent software engineers and 50 percent system administrators. 
such as Dropbox, Netflix and Github, are well-known for being at the forefront of technology leadership.

DevOps is a more recent movement, designed to help organizations’ IT departments move in agile and performant ways.
It builds a healthy working relationship between the Operations staff and Dev team, 
allowing each to see how their work influences and affects the other. 
By combining knowledge and effort, DevOps should produce a more robust, reliable, agile product.


While DevOps raise problems and dispatch them to Dev to solve, 
the SRE approach is to find problems and solve some of them themselves. 

While DevOps teams would usually choose the more conservative approach, leaving the production environment untouched unless absolutely necessary, 
SREs are more confident in their ability to maintain a stable production environment and push for rapid changes and software updates. 

Not unlike the DevOps team, SREs also thrive on a stable production environment, 
but one of the SRE team’s goals is to improve performance and operational efficiency.

• SHA-1: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt]
• MD5: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -md5 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt]

What are the demerits and merits while creating a certificate of our own ?

Advantages
1. No PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is needed.
2. Automatic deployment (Usually Self-signed certificates created automatic during the installation process of the server side applications).

Disadvantages
1. The certificates aren’t trusted by other applications/operating systems. This may lead to authentications errors etc.
Note: To overcome this limitation, some IT staff add the self-signed certificates to the Trusted Roots Certificate Authorities. However, using this workaround may to additional time that needed for management and troubleshooting.
2. Self-signed certificates life time is usually 1 years. Before the year is ended, the certificate may need to renew/replace.
3. Self-signed certificates may use low hash and cipher technologies. Due this, the security level that implemented by self-signed certificates may not satisfy the current Security Policy etc. .
4. No support for advanced PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) functions (e.g. Online checking of the revocation list etc.).
5. Most of the advanced feathers of the server side applications required to impended a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). By this, self-signed certificates advantages can't be used.
What is ca-certificates  and in which Algorithm it worked ?
CA certificates can also be used to establish trust relationships between CAs in two different public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchies.
Root CA Certificate
 Issuing CA Certificate
  User Certificate
The following are some of the trust scenarios that can be enabled by properly configured CA certificates:
 • Simple trust within an enterprise PKI
 • Cross trust between two enterprise CAs (restricted)
 • Bridge trust for multiple enterprise PKIs (unrestricted)
 • Certificate trust continuity when the certificate policy changes

To maintain high availability for incoming external connections on a single IP (e.g. a website),  I assume you need to use a load balancer that points to all of the worker and manager IP addresses. Is that right? What happens in the case of a leader going down? 
I read somewhere that it uses “Raft consensus” to elect a new leader. Is this also right?﻿

Yes,Raft consensus is used.If the leader fails then manual intervention would be required to remove the leader, and the remaining nodes would be restarted in “bootstrap” mode.

When you hit www.prokarma.com tell me the end to end flow how request traverse and fetches the result ?
Attention: this is an extremely rough and oversimplified sketch, assuming the simplest possible HTTP request (no HTTPS, no HTTP2, no extras), simplest possible DNS, no proxies, single-stack IPv4, one HTTP request only, a simple HTTP server on the other end, and no problems in any step. This is, for most contemporary intents and purposes, an unrealistic scenario; all of these are far more complex in actual use, and the tech stack has become an order of magnitude more complicated since this was written. With this in mind, the following timeline is still somewhat valid:
	1.	browser checks cache; if requested object is in cache and is fresh, skip to #9
	2.	browser asks OS for server's IP address
	3.	OS makes a DNS lookup and replies the IP address to the browser
	4.	browser opens a TCP connection to server (this step is much more complex with HTTPS)
	5.	browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection
	6.	browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request
	7.	browser checks if the response is a redirect or a conditional response (3xx result status codes), authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal responses (2xx)
	8.	if cacheable, response is stored in cache
	9.	browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped)
	10.	browser determines what to do with response (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an image, is it a sound clip?)
	11.	browser renders response, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types
Again, discussion of each of these points have filled countless pages; take this only as a summary, abridged for the sake of clarity. Also, there are many other things happening in parallel to this (processing typed-in address, speculative prefetching, adding page to browser history, displaying progress to user, notifying plugins and extensions, rendering the page while it's downloading, pipelining, connection tracking for keep-alive, cookie management, checking for malicious content etc.) - and the whole operation gets an order of magnitude more complex with HTTPS (certificates and ciphers and pinning, oh my!).

What is Elastic Search in AWS ?
Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. Elasticsearch is a popular open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analytics. With Amazon ES, you get direct access to the Elasticsearch APIs so that existing code and applications work seamlessly with the service.
Amazon ES provisions all the resources for your Elasticsearch cluster and launches the cluster. It also automatically detects and replaces failed Elasticsearch nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures. You can scale your cluster with a single API call or a few clicks in the console.
To get started using the service, you create an Amazon ES domain. An Amazon ES domain is an Elasticsearch cluster in the AWS Cloud that has the compute and storage resources that you specify. For example, you can specify the number of instances, instance types, and storage options.

Additionally, Amazon ES offers the following benefits of a managed service:
	•	Cluster scaling options
	•	Self-healing clusters
	•	Replication for data durability
	•	Enhanced security
	•	Node monitoring

at the last of the command we see $$ that produces a number. when I use echo $$ in bash I also see a number like bellow:
 #echo $$
 23019
$$ is the process ID of the current shell instance. So in your case the number, 23019, is the PID of that instance of bash.

Here was an extra disk (/dev/xvdf) in the m3.xlarge instance that was not listed in the EC2 console (may be instance store?) although it was included in its /etc/fstab. When changing instance to r3.xlarge the volume disappeared but still was trying to mount it because of fstab... just commented fstab line and voilà.

This is, for most contemporary intents and purposes, an unrealistic scenario; all of these are far more complex in actual use, and the tech stack has become an order of magnitude more complicated since this was written. With this in mind, the following timeline is still somewhat valid:1. browser checks cache; if requested object is in cache and is fresh, skip to #92. browser asks OS for server's IP address3. OS makes a DNS lookup and replies the IP address to the browser4. browser opens a TCP connection to server (this step is much more complex with HTTPS)5. browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection6. browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request7. browser checks if the response is a redirect or a conditional response (3xx result status codes), authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal responses (2xx)8. if cacheable, response is stored in cache9. browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped)10. browser determines what to do with response (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an image, is it a sound clip?)11. browser renders response, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized typesAgain, discussion of each of these points have filled countless pages; take this only as a summary, abridged for the sake of clarity. Also, there are many other things happening in parallel to this (processing typed-in address, speculative prefetching, adding page to browser history, displaying progress to user, notifying plugins and extensions, rendering the page while it's downloading, pipelining, connection tracking for keep-alive, cookie management, checking for malicious content etc.) - and the whole operation gets an order of magnitude more complex with HTTPS (certificates and ciphers and pinning, oh my!).—————————————————————Git stash ?Solution:git initGit branch	# QAGit checkout -b devops	# created a new branch devopstouch xGit commit -m “added one empty file”Git stash		# to save your local changesGit checkout QA	# switched to QA without commitGit statusGit checkout devopsGit merge QAGit push origin devops—————————————————————How to resolve the git conflicts ?https://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git—————————————————————What is tag in Git ?$ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"$ git tagv0.1v1.3v1.4—————————————————————How to configure the push concept in Ansible so to push the recent changes every after 30 mins to agent nodes ?Solution:- name: set hostname with file lookup  ops_template:    src: ./hostname.json    backup: yes    remote_user: admin    become: yes- name: set hostname with var  ops_template:    src: "{{ config }}"    remote_user: admin    become: yesNOte: config module does all thingsThe OpenSwitch platform provides a library for pushing JSON structured configuration files into the current running-config.

Elasticsearch is a popular open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analytics. With Amazon ES, you get direct access to the Elasticsearch APIs so that existing code and applications work seamlessly with the service.Amazon ES provisions all the resources for your Elasticsearch cluster and launches the cluster. It also automatically detects and replaces failed Elasticsearch nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures. You can scale your cluster with a single API call or a few clicks in the console.To get started using the service, you create an Amazon ES domain. An Amazon ES domain is an Elasticsearch cluster in the AWS Cloud that has the compute and storage resources that you specify. For example, you can specify the number of instances, instance types, and storage options.Additionally, Amazon ES offers the following benefits of a managed service:* Cluster scaling options* Self-healing clusters* Replication for data durability* Enhanced security* Node monitoring—————————————————————Write any Ansible playbook and explain ?Solutions:—- Hosts: WEB- Name: Copy the infinity files from host to windows machine- win_get_url:    - Src: ftp://<username>:<password>@<ip>/x/y/z/<file_name>.txt    - Dest: C:\Desktop\ftp\<file_name>.txt—————————————————————What $?

No PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is needed.2. Automatic deployment (Usually Self-signed certificates created automatic during the installation process of the server side applications).Disadvantages1. The certificates aren’t trusted by other applications/operating systems. This may lead to authentications errors etc.Note: To overcome this limitation, some IT staff add the self-signed certificates to the Trusted Roots Certificate Authorities. However, using this workaround may to additional time that needed for management and troubleshooting.2. Self-signed certificates life time is usually 1 years. Before the year is ended, the certificate may need to renew/replace.3. Self-signed certificates may use low hash and cipher technologies. Due this, the security level that implemented by self-signed certificates may not satisfy the current Security Policy etc. .4. No support for advanced PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) functions (e.g. Online checking of the revocation list etc.).5. Most of the advanced feathers of the server side applications required to impended a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). By this, self-signed certificates advantages can't be used.What is ca-certificates  and in which Algorithm it worked ?CA certificates can also be used to establish trust relationships between CAs in two different public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchies.Root CA Certificate Issuing CA Certificate  User CertificateThe following are some of the trust scenarios that can be enabled by properly configured CA certificates: • Simple trust within an enterprise PKI • Cross trust between two enterprise CAs (restricted) • Bridge trust for multiple enterprise PKIs (unrestricted) • Certificate trust continuity when the certificate policy changesHave you worked in hadoop and Are you good in SQL Queries ?

Python Interview Questions:

https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt

Quest-1:

List1 contains any no of employees and having an ages > 30 
List2 contains any no of employees and having an ages < 60 in the same organization

Fetch out the no of employees having an ages between 30 to 60 ??

Ques-2:
 
A folder will be the runtime argument and you need to traverse the folder and list all the files and folders, at some path there would be some scripts and you need to check weather the script is having the executable permission or not as well executing or not ??

Ques-3:

Two random inputs are there one is List and another is count.
List1 contains some random no of elements and inside count you need to pass any no of arguments say 2,

Suppose you passed count(2) so it will pick only two items from List and give the sum of two list elements which should be minimum of any two elements
Suppose you passed count(2) so it does the same operation but in this case it will give the maximum of any two elements.

Draw the K8s setup

￼

https://www.aquasec.com/wiki/display/containers/Kubernetes+Architecture+101

*********************************************************************************************

Explain the K8s components

Master Components:
	•	etcd cluster - 
	•	a simple key value storage 
	•	store the Kubernetes cluster data (such as number of pods, their state, namespace, etc), 
	•	etcd enables notifications to the cluster about configuration changes with the help of watchers. 

	•	kube-apiserver - 
	•	Kubernetes API server is the central management 
	•	that receives all REST requests for modifications (to pods, services, replication sets/controllers and others), 
	•	serving as frontend to the cluster. Also, 
	•	only component that communicates with the etcd cluster, 
	•	making sure data is stored in etcd and is in agreement with the service details of the deployed pods.
	•	kube-controller-manager - 
	•	runs a number of distinct controller processes in the background
	•	 (for example, replication controller controls number of replicas in a pod, endpoints controller populates endpoint objects like services and pods, and others) 
	•	When a change in a service configuration occurs (for example, replacing the image from which the pods are running, or changing parameters in the configuration yaml file), 
	•	the controller spots the change and starts working towards the new desired state.

	•	cloud-controller-manager - 
	•	is responsible for managing controller processes 
	•	For example, when a controller needs to check if a node was terminated or set up routes, load balancers or volumes in the cloud infrastructure, 

	•	kube-scheduler - 
	•	helps schedule the pods (a co-located group of containers inside which our application processes are running) 
	•	For example, if the application needs 1GB of memory and 2 CPU cores, then the pods for that application will be scheduled on a node with at least those resources. 
	•	The scheduler runs each time there is a need to schedule pods. The scheduler must know the total resources available as well as resources allocated to existing workloads on each node.
Worker Components:
	•	kubelet - 
	•	the main service on a node, 
	•	regularly taking in new or modified pod specifications (primarily through the kube-apiserver)
	•	ensuring that pods and their containers are healthy and running in the desired state. 
	•	This component also reports to the master on the health of the host where it is running.

	•	kube-proxy - 
	•	a proxy service that runs on each worker node to deal with individual host subnetting and expose services to the external world. 
	•	It performs request forwarding to the correct pods/containers across the various isolated networks in a cluster.

Explain difference between ALB,NLB,ELB

NLB: 
	network load balancer just forward requests 
ALB: 
	application load balancer examines the contents of the HTTP request header to determine where to route the request. 
	application load balancer is performing content based routing.
	HTTP, HTTPS
	EC2-VPC
	Load balancer generated
ELB:
	automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple applications, microservices, and containers hosted on Amazon EC2 instances.
CLB:
	Classic Load Balancer
	HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL
	YES (you can provide your own application cookie)

Write a simple Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu

ADD . /app

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs ssh mysql
RUN cd /app && npm install

# This should start three process, mysql, ssh in the backgorund 
# And node app in foreground

CMD mysql & sshd & npm start

Execution:

$ docker build -t <tag-name> <path-of-dockerfile>

Example to create own image:

$ docker build latest:npm Dockerfile .
$ docker build -t wtf .

*********************************************************************************************

Difference between RUN and CMD in Dockerfile

RUN:
	executes command(s) in a new layer and creates a new image.
	E.g., it is often used for installing software packages.
	RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
	bzr \
  	cvs \
  	git \
  	mercurial \
  	subversion

CMD:
	sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.
	CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]
	
Entrypoint:
	configures a container that will run as an executable.
	Example:
	ENV name John Dow
	ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo Hello, $name"]
	$ docker run -it <image>
	Hello, John Dow	# Output
	
Difference between ENTRYPOINT & CMD:
	CMD is executed only if ENTRYPOINT is between brackets.
	If ENTRYPOINT is between brackets, the file existence is checked with stats
	Behaves differently of RUN
	CMD/ENTRYPOINT are designed to accept only a single command	

Difference between RUN & CMD:
	RUN and CMD are both Dockerfile instructions. 
	RUN lets you execute commands inside of your Docker image.
	CMD lets you define a default command to run when your container starts. 
	CMD is a Docker run-time operation, meaning it's not something that gets executed at build time.

Explain Jenkinsfile

A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control. 
Jenkins Pipeline which implements a basic three-stage continuous delivery pipeline.

Example:
// Suppose you wanna to execute a project:
// Clone a Project	- Clone
// Versioning 	- Version
// Build Part	- Build & Package
// Docker Images	- DocImages
// Delete the Docker Images		- DocDeleteImages

node() {
    cleanWs()
    
    stage('Cloning'){
        checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/master']], doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false, extensions: [], submoduleCfg: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: ‘yruiwfjfk-ahefsnf-fjskjfkjkjf’, url: 'https://github.com/xavyaly/game-of-life.git']]])
    }
}

   stage(‘Versioning’) {
	VERSION_NUM = VersionNumber([projectStartDate: '2017-11-20’, versionNumberString: ‘1.0.1_${2018, XXX}’, versionPrefix: 'v'])
	    //VERSION_NUM = VersionNumber([projectStartDate: '2017-11-20', versionNumberString: '${2018, XX}', versionPrefix: 'v']);

    //}

*********************************************************************************************

Kind of Deployment Strategy

	•	Recreate: Version A is terminated then version B is rolled out.
	•	Ramped (also known as rolling-update or incremental): Version B is slowly rolled out and replacing version A.
	•	Blue/Green: Version B is released alongside version A, then the traffic is switched to version B.
	•	Canary: Version B is released to a subset of users, then proceed to a full rollout.
	•	A/B testing: Version B is released to a subset of users under specific condition.
	•	Shadow: Version B receives real-world traffic alongside version A and doesn’t impact the response.

Difference between git reset and git revert:

$ git reset:
	git reset will reset the state of the branch to a previous state by dropping all the changes post the desired commit
	$ git reset --hard a0fvf8

$ git revert 
	git revert will reset to a previous state by creating new reverting commits and keep the original commits.
	git revert OLDER_COMMIT^..NEWER_COMMIT

Note:
	It's recommended to use git revert instead of git reset in enterprise environment.

Difference between Build Periodically and Poll SCM:

Poll SCM 
	periodically polls the SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) and 
	builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build, 
whereas 
Build periodically builds the project periodically even if nothing has changed.

MINUTE: Minutes within the hour (0-59)
HOUR: The hour of the day (0-23)
DOM: The day of the month (1-31)

Have you ever created any certificate ? Yes, through openssl command
The commands below can be used to view the certificate fingerprint/thumbprint.
• SHA-256: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt] 
• SHA-1: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt]
• MD5: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -md5 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt] 

What is the demerits and merits while creating a certificate by our own ?
Advantages
1. No PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is needed.
2. Automatic deployment (Usually Self-signed certificates created automatic during the installation process of the server side applications).
Disadvantages
1. The certificates aren’t trusted by other applications/operating systems. This may lead to authentications errors etc.
Note: To overcome this limitation, some IT staff add the self-signed certificates to the Trusted Roots Certificate Authorities. However, using this workaround may to additional time that needed for management and troubleshooting.
2. Self-signed certificates life time is usually 1 years. Before the year is ended, the certificate may need to renew/replace.
3. Self-signed certificates may use low hash and cipher technologies. Due this, the security level that implemented by self-signed certificates may not satisfy the current Security Policy etc. .
4. No support for advanced PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) functions (e.g. Online checking of the revocation list etc.).
5. Most of the advanced feathers of the server side applications required to impended a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). By this, self-signed certificates advantages can't be used.

What is ca-certificates  and in which Algorithm it worked ?
CA certificates can also be used to establish trust relationships between CAs in two different public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchies.
Root CA Certificate 
	Issuing CA Certificate
		User Certificate
The following are some of the trust scenarios that can be enabled by properly configured CA certificates:
	• Simple trust within an enterprise PKI
	• Cross trust between two enterprise CAs (restricted)
	• Bridge trust for multiple enterprise PKIs (unrestricted)
	• Certificate trust continuity when the certificate policy changes

Difference between jar war and ear files in java ?
In J2EE application, modules are packaged as EAR, JAR and WAR based on their functionality
JAR: EJB modules which contain enterprise java beans (class files) and EJB deployment descriptor are packed as JAR files with .jar extenstion
WAR: Web modules which contain Servlet class files, JSP Files, supporting files, GIF and HTML files are packaged as JAR file with .war (web archive) extension
EAR: All above files (.jar and .war) are packaged as JAR file with .ear (enterprise archive) extension and deployed into Application Server.

Javeds-MacBook-Air:DevOps-Interview-Questions javedalam$ 


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

AWS Questionnaires:
------------
1) Create an SQS queue.  This SQS queue should take s3 bucket names as an input.  Maybe it should also take the region of the s3 bucket as well?  You might want to have it take a JSON object {"bucketname": "this_is_my_bucket", "region": "us-west-2"}

2)  Have a lambda subscribe to the SQS queue.  It takes the bucketname that it gets from the queue, and iterates over each object in that bucket and changes the objects from private to public if necessary.  It should not make any change to the ACL if the object is not public.  Also, if the bucket is tagged isPublic = True, then it should not do anything to the object ACLs, even if they are public.

3) Once we've tested step 1 and 2, we can create a lambda that lists all of the buckets, and then for each bucket, sends a message to the SQS queue for each bucket it sees.  This will allow us to have multiple lambdas running at once, each looking at a different bucket.

What do the HTTP status codes, such as 403, 404, 500, mean?
Web Hosting Basic knowledge
For every request from a webbrowser the server responds with a status code. If there was a error, you can get additional information about the error. You can find the most frequent error codes and a brief description in the list below.
#
HTTP Error 400 - Bad Request
The server can't process the request due to clientside errors.
#
HTTP Error 401 - Unauthorized
The 401 status code indicates that the HTTP request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials (usually username and password) for the target resource.
If the request included authentication credentials, the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. Please check if your username and password are correct.
#
HTTP status 403 - Forbidden
This is a permissions issue. You often encounter this error when no index file (.htm, .html or .php) is present and the directory listing is off for a folder in the Web space (Line "Options -Indexes" in a .htaccess file).
Sometimes user authentication was provided, but the authenticated user is not permitted to view the content of the folder or file. Other times the operation is forbidden to all users. Sometimes this error occurs if there are too many connections at the same time. The easyname support team can explain you this issue in depth.
#
HTTP status 404 - Not Found
This error message is shown when a site or folder on a server are requested but cannot be found at the given URL. Please check your input.
Please note that this error can also appear if there is no start file (index.php or index.html).
#
HTTP Error 408 - Request Timeout
The server took longer than it's allocated timeout window. In this case the server terminates the connection.
#
HTTP status 429 - Too Many Requests
The HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response status code indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.
A Retry-After header might be included to this response indicating how long to wait before making a new request. For example if more than 50 requests are received from the same IP address (cumulative hits) within the same second, our server will block that IP for the next 10 minutes as a security measure.
#
HTTP status 500 - Internal Server Error
This is a "catch all" status for unexpected errors. The server side error message is commonly caused by eg. misconfigured .htaccess files or PHP errors, which you you can check in the file php_error.log on your Webhost.
You can find the php_error.log file in the /log/ directory - this directory can be found on the same level as your /html/ directory
#
HTTP status 502 - Bad Gateway
This HTTP status code indicates, that under the specified URL there's no content to be displayed.
#
HTTP status 503 - Service unavailable
This means, that the server is currently unavailable or the server is overallocated. You can check the file php_error.log as described for the status code 500.
Should you not find helpful error messages in the logfile, please try changing the session_cache to the option filesystem, you can do this in the easyname control panel if you navigate to [Web Hosting] → [PHP settings] and click the link "Settings".
Please note that this change will take up to 15 minutes to take effect, so please try waiting 15 minutes before trying to call up your site and refresh it.
#
HTTP status 504 - Gateway timeout
This means, that the server has not responded within the specified time period.

Filebeat: Installed on client servers that will send their logs to logstash, 
Filebeat acts as a log shipping agent that utilizes the lumberjack networking protocol to communicate with Logstash

Logstash: server component that processes incoming logs

Elasticsearch: stores all the logs

Kibana: web interface for searching and visualizing logs, which will be proxied through Nginx

How we use modules in terraform & what is the benefit of modules in terraform ?

Solution:
https://medium.com/@mitesh_shamra/module-in-terraform-920257136228

Modules can’t inherit or reference parent resources, we need to pass them to the module explicitly as input variables. Modules are self-contained packages which can be shared across teams for different projects.

Example:
https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/2.24.0

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "2.24.0"
  # insert the 8 required variables here
}

To run this:
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply

Scripting questions to automate day to day tasks (cloud watch, cost scripts)

Automate Cloud Watch Monitoring:
I have several dashboards in CloudWatch that represent a view of my infrastructure: Number of instances from an autoscaling-group that are currently running, the CPU/Disk usage per instance, etc. However, when I update an autoscaling-group, I have to manually update the dashboards (autoscaling-group ID) to include its EC2 instances in the display. I'm looking for some kind of metric/dimension that can filter autoscaling-groups by tag. Is it possible, if yes then how? if no, how can I make it differently?

You can build lambda function to do this job.
Configure lambda function to trigger every few minutes and check the autoscaling group for addition/removal of instances and update the cloudwatch dashboard accordingly
1 . Create a lambda function to check the instance present in the ASG and update the CW dashboard based on the instances present in the dashboard.
2 . Create a cloudwatch rule to trigger the lambda function every 5/10 minutes

What happens when you type google.com into your browser that causes a web page to return to you? 

Solution:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyzBe6cUgNI

https://dev.to/antonfrattaroli/what-happens-when-you-type-googlecom-into-a-browser-and-press-enter-39g8

“What happens when you type in a URL” is a deceptive question commonly asked in tech interviews. If you look online, there are many very detailed resources but few concise explanations of how a web browser, a server, and the general internet work together.

This is how I would explain it:
	1.	You enter a URL into a web browser
	2.	The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
	3.	The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
	4.	The server sends back a HTTP response
	5.	The browser begins rendering the HTML
	6.	The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
	7.	Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.

That’s really it. Here’s a description in words for this site.
When you type “https://wsvincent.com” into your browser the first thing that happens is a Domain Name Server (DNS) matches “wsvincent.com” to an IP address. Then the browser sends an HTTP request to the server and the server sends back an HTTP response. The browser begins rendering the HTML on the page while also requesting any additional resources such as CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. Each subsequent request completes a request/response cycle and is rendered in turn by the browser. Then once the page is loaded some sites (though not mine) will make further asynchronous requests.
If I were asked to explain further I might start talking about how the server and browser connect via TCP. And we could discuss encryption via https, too.

What's the difference between a hard link and a soft link' ?

Solution:
https://medium.com/@krisbredemeier/the-difference-between-hard-links-and-soft-or-symbolic-links-780149244f7d

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/soft-hard-links-unixlinux/

Soft Link or Symbolic links
1. Soft Links have different inodes numbers.
2. ls -l command shows all links with second column value 1 and the link points to the original file.
3. Soft Link contains the path for original file and not the contents.
4. Removing soft link doesn't affect anything but when the original file is removed, the link becomes a 'dangling' link that points to nonexistent file.
5. A Soft Link can link to a directory.
	•	Command to create a Soft link is:$ ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 
Hard Links
1. Hard Links have same inodes number.
2. ls -l command shows all the links with the link column showing the number of links.
3. Links have actual file contents
4. Removing any link, just reduces the link count but doesn't affect the other links.
5. You cannot create a Hard Link for a directory.
	•	Even if the original file is removed, the link will still show you the contents of the file.Command to create a hard link is:$ ln  [original filename] [link name]

What if the web page doesn’t appear — how do you debug the problem ?

Solution:
	•	403 Forbidden: You’re not allowed to access this page. Check the address and try again.
	•	404 Page Not Found: The page you’re trying to access no longer exists. Check the address and try again. This could mean the webmaster has moved the page, or something has broken.
	•	500 Internal Server Error: There’s a problem with the server that hosts the website. This isn’t something you can resolve, so try again later.

Given an Nginx/Apache web server log(s), how many requests are made per day?
View level of traffic with Apache access log

Solution:
https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/uncategorized/view-level-of-traffic-with-apache-access-log/

 STEPS:
Login to your server via SSH

cd ~userna5/access-logs

Run the following command to view what Apache access logs are currently in the directory:
ls -lahtr
drwxr-xr-x 3 root at0m 4.0K Dec 31 16:47 .
drwx--x--x 9 root wheel 4.0K Jan 4 06:01 ..
-rw-r----- 2 root at0m 15K Jan 9 05:09 ftp.example.com-ftp_log
-rw-r----- 2 root at0m 3M Jan 23 13:10 example.com

	•	View Apache requests per day

awk '{print $4}' example.com | cut -d: -f1 | uniq -c		
You should get back something like this:
6095 [20/Jan/2013
7281 [21/Jan/2013
6517 [22/Jan/2013
5278 [23/Jan/2013
	•	View Apache requests per hour

grep "23/Jan" progolfdeal.com | cut -d[ -f2 | cut -d] -f1 | awk -F: '{print $2":00"}' | sort -n | uniq -c		
You should get back something like this:
200 00:00
417 01:00
244 02:00
242 03:00

	•	View Apache requests per minute

grep "23/Jan/2013:06" example.com | cut -d[ -f2 | cut -d] -f1 | awk -F: '{print $2":"$3}' | sort -nk1 -nk2 | uniq -c | awk '{ if ($1 > 10) print $0}'

Extra:
Features	NGINX	Apache
Access log location	/var/log/nginx/access.log	/var/log/apache/access.log
Error log location	/var/log/nginx/error.log	/var/log/apache/error.log
Can access log format be modified?	Yes	Yes
Can error log format be modified?	No	Yes

Conclusion
While NGINX and Apache are wildly different web servers, both of their logging approaches are relatively the same. The advantage to this is that there is no real inherent logging benefit to using one server over the other, which gives you the ability to change servers with minimal changes to your application monitoring infrastructure. Regardless of the similarities in logging approach, however, what’s important in the end is the value of the information provided, not the format it is presented in.

Which IPs are the most frequent visitors ? Which pages are the most requested?

Solution:
I was wondering if it is possible to see the IP addresses of the most frequent site visitors? There are some competitors spying on my websites, and I wanted to block them from visiting (via .htaccess or other means). I wanted to find out if there is a way to see which IP visits my site the most, and frequently, and block the entire subnet.

You can install a independent visitor tracker like tracewatch that will tell you wich ip is very frequently visiting your site and wich pages they look at.

Write a function to find the two maximum response times in a log file?

Solution:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/310606/need-to-find-a-response-time-which-takes-from-1-3-seconds-in-apache-logs

—————
I came up with below code using grep, sed and awk commands, which is printing average response time for each log file.

for file in *; do 
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then 
        cat $file | grep ".*Eligible programs received from program service for user .*" | sed -E -n "s/.*Eligible programs received from program service for user .* in (.*) ms.*/\\1/p" | awk '{ SUM += $1; COUNT += 1;} END { print SUM/COUNT }'
    fi 
done

I need to find the API response time from an Apache log file. It's like a response time which is takes between 1 to 2 secound or 2 to 3 second. $6 is response time and values comes in microseconds.

I am trying with following command but the output is always the same:

$ grep 17/Sep/2016:10 /access.log | awk '{ print ($6 > 1000000 && 2000000 > $6) }' | wc -l

This question would be clearer if some lines of access.log were added as a sample. Anyway, the awk command prints a line regardless of the value of $6, so when you count the lines with wc -l you get an outcome that is determined by grep alone.
If you want to count the lines where is $6 is between two different values you can write

$ grep 17/Sep/2016:10 /access.log | awk '$6 > 1000000 && 2000000 > $6' | wc -l

However, this pipeline is a bit inefficient. It would almost always be preferable to combine it in a single awk command like this:

$ awk '/17\/Sep\/2016:10/ && $6 > 1000000 && 2000000 > $6 {c++} END{print c}' access.log

To include the boundaries one can do:

$ grep 18/Sep/2016:11 /access.log | awk ' $6>=1000000 && $6<=2000000' | wc -l

or equivalently

$ awk '/18\/Sep\/2016:11/ && $6>=1000000 && $6<=2000000 {c++} END{print c}' access.log

Difference between Network & Application load balancer ?

Solution:
ALB can only handle HTTP/HTTPS requests, unlike the NLB that can handle any type of TCP requests.
ALB is at layer 7 on the OSI model -- this means it exists at the application level -- and the NLB is at layer 4 which means it works at the transport level.
